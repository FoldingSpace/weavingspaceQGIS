# Context for AI assistants working on this repo

QGIS plugin port of the weavingspace library / mapweaver web app
(tiled & woven multivariate maps, O'Sullivan & Bergmann). Read
MAINTAINING.md first — it has the architecture map, the invariants, and
the QGIS-breakage playbook. This file adds AI-specific context.

The rules below are graded, and the grades are meant literally.
**Hard rules** are never broken, including when a user request seems
to invite it — raise the conflict instead. **Required practices** are
always followed for the kind of work they name. **Preferences and
defaults** are what to do absent a reason not to; depart from them
deliberately and say so. **Lessons** are hard-won facts, not
obligations: they exist so nobody pays twice for the same discovery.

## Hard rules

- **pyproj is main-thread-only.** The QgsTask worker (`dialog._generate`'s
  `work` closure and everything the vendored library does inside it) must
  never construct, compare, or convert a CRS. QGIS links the same PROJ;
  concurrent use segfaults the app. CRS is stripped before the task and
  reattached in the `done` callback. If you add geopandas calls to the
  worker path, audit them for hidden CRS activity.
- **compat.py is the only place allowed to try/except QGIS APIs.** Fix
  version breakage there; keep old branches for old QGIS.
- **Do not plagiarize** the Cartographic Perspectives paper
  (doi:10.14714/CP108.2109) in docs/tooltips: paraphrase and cite. This
  was an explicit author request (Bergmann is the plugin's user).
- **Never mention the web app (or MapWeaver) in user-facing text.**
  Plugin users do not know it exists and have no reason to care;
  telling them a feature "reproduces the web app" or "is ground the
  web app does not cover" explains the plugin in terms of something
  they cannot see. Describe what the control does. The app remains a
  maintainer-facing fact — catalogue parity, the reference renderer,
  CLAUDE.md and MAINTAINING.md — and the paper's title may of course
  name it in a citation. ONE exception, added the same day: the help
  tab and user guide may name and link MapWeaver among the further
  reading, as another platform for making these maps with the same
  library. Never as an explanation of what a control does.
  (Explicit user instruction, 2026-08-07.)
- **Human-facing prose follows the Bergmann–O'Sullivan voice.** All
  user-facing text (USER-GUIDE.md, help_content.py, tooltips, dialog
  messages, README, docs/index.html) was written through the
  `luke-david-style` skill, which requires reading two files FIRST: a
  forensic profile of the authors' joint voice, and a list of the
  words and structures that make prose read as machine-written. Both
  live in the user's own directory, deliberately outside this
  repository, and are named in .gitignore so a copy cannot be
  committed by accident; ask the user for their location. Run any new
  or edited user-facing prose through the same pipeline; in
  particular, avoid em-dash habits and bullet-heavy structure.
- deps.py must never install numpy 2.x or shadow an adequate
  QGIS-shipped package; wheels extract only into the plugin's `libs/`.
- **Nothing sensitive is ever committed or pushed.** No credentials,
  API keys, tokens, private key material, `.env` files, or anything
  else that would be a problem in public. Machine-specific paths
  (`/Users/<anyone>`) count too: not secret, but they leak a directory
  layout for no reason and mark a file as written for one machine
  rather than for a reader. `tools/check_no_secrets.py` enforces this
  over exactly the files a commit would contain, and `release.py` runs
  it twice — once before the expensive work and once immediately
  before committing, because a leaked key is the single failure a
  later release cannot undo. Entries in its ALLOWED list need a
  written reason, like every other exception here. The private style
  guide governing this project's prose stays outside the repository
  and is named in `.gitignore` so a stray copy cannot arrive by
  accident. (Firm user instruction, 2026-08-07.)
- **GitHub is the only distribution channel.** The repository is
  `FoldingSpace/weavingspaceQGIS` (public); builds reach users as
  GitHub Release assets, and reach the user directly as a chat
  attachment when they ask. Still no claude.ai artifacts, no
  third-party file hosts, no upload services. Pushing happens through
  `release.py --push` or at the user's explicit request, never as a
  side effect of other work: commit and tag are local and reversible,
  a push is neither. (Revised 2026-08-07; the earlier form of this
  rule forbade publishing anywhere at all, which held until the
  repository existed.)
- **User-facing documentation is clear and concise.** Say what the
  control does and what the user should know about it, then stop. The
  guide and help tab are reference material somebody reads while
  trying to finish a map, not an argument for the technique; the
  reasoning belongs in the article, and the maintainer's reasoning
  belongs in docstrings. This applies to new sections and to edits of
  old ones. (User instruction, 2026-08-08.)
- **Tooltips are VERY SHORT: fifteen words at most, usually under
  twelve.** A tooltip is a nudge at the point of use, not a paragraph
  in a yellow box; the user guide and the Help tab carry the fuller
  explanation and both already exist. Enforced by
  `test_every_control_explains_itself`, which also requires every
  control to HAVE one (the README promises it) and rejects a tooltip
  of one or two words that merely repeats the label. The rule arrived
  after twenty of thirty-six tooltips had drifted to between nineteen
  and sixty-one words. (User instruction, 2026-08-09.)
- **Canadian spelling in all user-facing text**: colour, colourmap,
  behaviour, and -ize verbs (symbolize, categorize, organize). Code
  identifiers that mirror a QGIS or matplotlib API keep that API's
  spelling (`colors_to_use`, `setColor`); everything a user reads uses
  the user's spelling.

## Required practices

- **Documentation standard**: all new code carries docstrings and
  section comments written for a weavingspace-literate, QGIS-naive
  maintainer — explain each QGIS/Qt concept at its point of use. This
  is an explicit user requirement; match the density of the existing
  modules. It applies to **everything this project writes** — the
  plugin package, `tools/`, `tests/`, `build.py` and `release.py`
  alike — and not merely to code inside the plugin folder. The
  checker enforced it on the package only until 2026-08-09, which
  left the tooling ungoverned while that tooling grew to rewrite
  shipped source, decide the mutation score and write into a user's
  QGIS profiles. `vendor/` is the one exclusion, because it is
  upstream's code held verbatim: our conventions there would either
  be discarded at the next re-vendor or fail forever. (User
  instruction, 2026-08-09.) Specifically:
  - document INPUTS AND OUTPUTS, not just purpose: an Args block that
    says what each argument means and what happens when it is
    omitted, a Returns block that says what the caller gets and
    whether anything was mutated, and Raises where a caller could
    reasonably be surprised;
  - say what a value means in this project's terms ("the passing
    pattern as typed, e.g. 1,2,2,1"), not its type alone;
  - add comments in the MIDDLE of longer functions, at the points a
    reader would otherwise stop and wonder — why this order, why this
    guard, why this apparently redundant step;
  - when a choice has a reason that is not obvious from the code
    (thread safety, an upstream semantic, a Qt quirk, a bug this
    prevents), the reason belongs at that line.
- **Generated documents are regenerated, never remembered.**
  `docs/TEST-MAP.md` and `docs/BUG-REGISTER.md` are produced from the
  suite — the map from the `check()` registrations, the register from
  the `Regression:` lines — so neither is ever hand-edited and both
  are regenerated whenever the suite gains, loses or renames a test:

      python3 tools/test_map.py
      python3 tools/bug_register.py

  A generated document nobody regenerates is worse than none, because
  it keeps its authority while losing its accuracy, and the map is
  consulted precisely when deciding where to write tests next. This
  used to rely on somebody noticing — the register drifted for a
  whole session and was corrected only when the user asked — so it no
  longer relies on anyone: `tools/check_standards.py` recounts both
  with the GENERATORS' OWN rules and fails when either document
  disagrees with the suite, and `release.py` regenerates both. If you
  add a test and the standards check complains, it is telling you to
  run the two commands above, not to edit a number. (Made enforced
  2026-08-09, after the user pointed out they kept having to ask.)
- **The standards are ENFORCED at release, not merely intended.**
  `release.py` runs `tools/check_standards.py` before anything else,
  and refuses to build a zip when it fails. It checks what this file
  says: every reachable function and class documented, functions of
  two or more arguments documenting them, no mutation markers left in
  shipped source, no user-facing text explaining anything in terms of
  the web app (links under further reading excepted), Canadian
  spelling in prose, and a mutation catalogue whose entries all name
  tests that still exist. Each of those rules was kept faithfully
  right up until the day it was forgotten; the check exists because
  intentions do not survive a long session. When a rule genuinely
  should change, change it in the checker deliberately — do not
  weaken it to make a release pass.
- **A substantial release goes out as a CANDIDATE first.**
  `python3 release.py --rc` runs the same correctness gates and then
  stops, writing `dist/weavingspace_qgis-<version>rc<n>.zip` and
  committing nothing. The gates answer whether the plugin is correct;
  only somebody making a map with it can say whether it is any good to
  use, and that feedback has to arrive before the version is tagged
  rather than after. The candidate announces itself as `<version>rcN`
  in QGIS's plugin manager (substituted inside the archive; the
  version on disk is untouched) so a tester always knows which build
  they have. (User instruction, 2026-08-08; details in
  docs/PUBLISHING.md.)
- **A release PROMOTES a candidate; it never re-derives one.** A
  candidate that passes every gate writes a receipt
  (`dist/CANDIDATE-<label>.receipt.json`) holding a digest of exactly
  the files that ship, taken with `build.py`'s own `shipped_files()`
  so the two rules cannot drift. `release.py` then REFUSES unless a
  receipt matches the tree in front of it, and having found one it
  skips the suite, gallery, coverage and reference comparison — those
  measured this artefact already, and re-running them would measure
  whatever the tree looks like now rather than what somebody
  installed. Change one shipped byte after the candidate and the
  release stops and says which case it is. The digest deliberately
  ignores tests, tooling and documentation: those cannot change what
  a reviewer ran, and a gate that fires on a comment in the suite is
  a gate people learn to route around. Guarded by
  `test_a_release_needs_a_matching_candidate` and
  `test_the_release_digest_watches_what_ships`. (User instruction,
  2026-08-09: a release must not be triggerable except on a clean
  candidate, and must not redo work the candidate already did.)
- **A candidate number is spent by anything bearing it.**
  `next_candidate` counts zips, dossiers AND receipts, so deleting an
  artefact cannot hand its number back. It used to count zips alone,
  and a dossier for `0.24.0rc3` sitting beside no zip would have made
  the next build a second, different rc3 — one name, two trees. A gap
  in the sequence confuses nobody; a reused name confuses everybody.
  Guarded by `test_a_candidate_number_is_never_reused`.
- **Releases go through `python3 release.py`**; never hand the user a
  zip that did not come out of it (details under "The test suite").
  Every release writes reports/v<version>/testing-report.md listing
  each test individually with its result and measured values; report
  those per-test results to the user whenever something is published
  (an explicit user requirement, 2026-08).
- **Published images show real data displayed as a map.** Every image
  in README.md and docs/index.html shows a named place with
  recognisable geography, region outlines and a legend where the
  classes need one -- not an abstract pattern. A reader is asking what
  they could produce with their own data at the end of an afternoon,
  and a field of coloured hexagons answers a different question: it
  shows the mechanics rather than the output, and quietly argues
  against the plugin's own claim that several attributes of real
  places can be read from one map. Figures from the published article
  are better still where their licence allows, attributed in the
  caption. (User instruction, 2026-08-08; details in
  docs/PUBLISHING.md.)
- **A release publishes CONTENT, not only a zip, and the content is
  re-checked every time.** README.md and docs/index.html show the
  dialog and a set of maps; those are claims about how the plugin
  currently looks and what it currently produces, and they rot
  silently. So `release.py` re-photographs them from THIS release's
  gallery (`tools/make_site_images.py`) and then audits every other
  claim the published files make (`tools/sync_release_content.py`):
  the citation version, a changelog entry for this version, images
  that exist and were actually regenerated, relative links that
  resolve, the vendored library version against the stamp the
  vendoring tool wrote, and the repository URLs against metadata.txt.
  Mechanical corrections are applied automatically; anything needing
  words stops the release. Prefer small judicious edits to published
  prose over rewriting it — accumulated small changes are cheaper to
  read than a document that is new every release. (User instruction,
  2026-08-07.)
- **Upstream library updates go through
  `tools/vendor_weavingspace.py`** (details under "The original
  library").
- **Check upstream before running the test suite.** Fetch the
  weavingspace repo, compare its version AND its head commit with what
  we vendor (upstream does not always bump the version string when
  code changes), and OFFER any new version to the user rather than
  taking it silently. Say what actually changed: compare structurally
  (AST with docstrings stripped) so the offer can distinguish a
  licence-header release from a behavioural one. This rule has already
  paid for itself twice — it caught a licence-only bump, and it caught
  upstream adopting our own convex-hull optimisation, which let us
  retire a patch instead of carrying a duplicate of it forever.
  (Standing user instruction, 2026-08-07.)
- **The testing documents are binding, are read BEFORE tests are
  written or changed, and are UPDATED the moment one of them is proved
  incomplete.** A lesson learned and not written down is a lesson
  about to be paid for twice, which is the provenance of a good many
  entries in these files. `docs/TESTING.md` holds the shapes that earn
  their keep here and the lessons each paid for once; nearly every
  rule in it exists because its absence cost this project real time.
  `docs/MUTATION-TESTING.md` holds the campaign and its commitments,
  and `docs/MUTATION-LOOP.md` is the runbook for running that campaign
  again from scratch: how to launch a cycle (`tools/loop/cycle.sh`),
  how to supervise it so the machine is never idle and no watcher goes
  silent or repeats itself (`tools/loop/health.sh`, a stage monitor
  and a ten-minute heartbeat), how to triage a survivor into one of
  five kinds, and when the campaign may be called finished.
  Treat both as you would the hard rules above: when you find yourself
  about to do something they warn against, the document is right and
  the shortcut is not. When one of them turns out to be wrong, change
  the document deliberately and say why, exactly as with the
  standards checker.
- **New code is held to account at every release, not only during a
  campaign.** `release.py` re-records per-test coverage and then runs
  `tools/mutate_auto.py --since <previous tag> --require 70`, which
  mutates ONLY the lines that changed and stops the release if the
  tests written alongside them fail to catch 70% of those mutants.
  Cost is proportional to the change, so it runs every time, which is
  the point: a mutation score decays not through decisions but
  through changes that nobody measured. This does not replace the
  periodic full campaign — changed lines are where new gaps arrive,
  but a refactor elsewhere can quietly stop an old test reaching what
  it names, and only full sampling finds that.
- **Census and sample answer different questions, and a census
  carries a firmer rule.** Sample to learn how good the suite is (the
  population estimate, and the only thing fit to certify); census a
  cost stratum with `--max-cost` to learn what to fix (exact rate,
  complete survivor list). A RE-census is a controlled before/after
  only while the plugin source is unchanged, since mutants are
  generated from that source — if it changed, the delta does not
  exist and a fresh baseline is required. Because a census hands over
  a named list of survivors, it is unusually easy to write tests
  aimed at mutants rather than behaviours: every test added in
  response to a survivor must name the harm a user would suffer AND
  be a test we would have wanted anyway. If neither holds, ACCEPT the
  survivor and record why — accepting is a legitimate outcome, and a
  campaign that never accepts anything is chasing a number rather
  than testing. Full reasoning in docs/MUTATION-TESTING.md.
- **Mutation testing has commitments, and they bind.** The full
  reasoning is in `docs/MUTATION-TESTING.md`; what must not be
  forgotten while working: close a survivor with the test the
  BEHAVIOUR deserves, never one aimed at the mutated token, and if
  you cannot state the harm a user would suffer, it is not a gap —
  mark it equivalent (with evidence) or accept it and say why. Prefer
  DELETING a line that does not earn its keep to writing a test that
  defends it. Equivalence claims are demonstrated, not asserted:
  apply the mutation in a sandbox and compare everything a test could
  see, then record the evidence in `EQUIVALENT` in
  `tools/mutate_auto.py`. Keep exclusions narrow and declared in the
  source — the only one is table column widths in pixels, and an
  earlier "pixel geometry" version of it was too broad, since
  geometry in this application usually means the map. Report rates
  per module as well as blended, so deterministic logic cannot hide
  behind Qt plumbing. Certify OUT OF SAMPLE: improvement rounds fix
  what they find, then a final batch runs with the suite frozen, and
  the number quoted is the conservative Clopper–Pearson bound rather
  than the raw fraction. None of this is optional politeness — every
  one of these rules exists because its absence would have let a
  number rise while the software stayed the same.
- **Every test that produces a map checks it visually, and those
  checks appear in the release PDF.** Two shapes: `visual_pair` when
  the settings can be restated independently (render the dialog's map
  beside one built by calling the library directly, compare interior
  pixels), and `visual_gamut` when they cannot (assert every interior
  pixel is a colour the ramps in force can make). A map-producing test
  that only counts features is not finished. (Standing user
  instruction, 2026-08-06.)

## Working economically in a long session

A long session ends when the context window fills, and it fills faster
than it looks. None of the rules below trade away rigour; they are
about not paying twice for the same information. Measured on the
2026-08-09 session, which filled the window in about four hours.

- **Batch edits per file.** Every edit causes the harness to re-inject
  a large slice of that file. Six small edits to dialog.py cost six
  re-injections; one pass costs one. Plan the whole change to a file,
  then make it.
- **Write scripts to the scratchpad and run them; do not paste long
  heredocs.** An inline script is echoed back in full. The same script
  written to a file and run costs a line. (It also survives the
  quoting traps: nested triple quotes break a heredoc.)
- **Grep for the answer, do not read for it.** Targeted `grep -n` with
  a little context beats reading a wide region, and beats re-reading
  something already seen. Trust your own notes.
- **Give one file one owner.** Two agents, or an agent and you,
  editing the same file collide AND double the re-injections. Assign
  whole files.
- **Ask subagents for short reports.** "Under 150 words unless
  something is wrong, then say what" keeps the findings and drops the
  narration. Four verbose agent reports cost several thousand words in
  one session. Agents are cheap in context (only the report returns)
  and expensive in tokens; they cannot be steered once started, so
  they suit well-bounded work on files nobody else is touching. The
  documentation pass was exactly that shape, and turned up five real
  defects nobody had gone looking for.
- **Background the long computations, keep the editing in front of
  you.** A suite, a coverage record or a mutation batch consumes no
  context while it runs, so start it early and do something else. But
  the preference is not unconditional, and the costs are real:
  a failure is discovered late (gate every chain so it stops at the
  first red stage rather than wasting hours); polling is not free, so
  a heartbeat should be stopped when nothing is running; and above
  all, background work LOCKS THE TREE — source cannot be edited while
  coverage records, which serialises everything else. Contention also
  degrades the measurement: four workers plus a suite is how a batch
  loses mutants to timeouts. Background what is long and
  self-contained; foreground what you need to react to.
- **Do not read binaries.** Summarise a zip with `zipfile`, an image
  with `sips`. Read an image only when a visual judgement IS the task
  (choosing an icon, checking a rendered page) — then it earns its
  cost.
- **Write the handover before the window is tight, not after.**
  `dev/state-of-play.md` is the durable record; the rules themselves
  belong in this file and in docs/, which survive compaction on their
  own.

## How we decide things

- **Reach for `/grill-me` when a decision carries weight.** Anything
  that changes the UI's shape, the output contract, what gets stored
  in a file, or a rule other work will lean on deserves the
  one-question-at-a-time treatment BEFORE any code is written: look
  the facts up yourself, put each decision to the user with a
  recommendation, and implement nothing until they confirm shared
  understanding. This is the user's stated preference, and the
  sessions that went that way (per-element layer output, the
  categorical colour sources, grid and stripes, layer opacity)
  produced designs that stuck; the ones that skipped it produced work
  that had to be unpicked. Small mechanical changes do not need it.
- **A feature does not have to exist in the web app or the library.**
  The plugin is allowed its own ideas where they fit QGIS: the
  Reverse-ramp column, per-element opacity, grid and stripes, the
  GeoPackage output. The test is whether it fits how QGIS works and
  how this plugin already behaves, not whether it has a precedent
  elsewhere.
- **Prefer the QGIS-native mechanism over a bespoke one — as a
  default, not a law.** When QGIS already models a thing, use its
  model: layer opacity rather than alpha baked into ramp colours,
  standard renderers rather than a plugin styling UI, QgsStyle ramps
  rather than our own palette widget. Native mechanisms round-trip
  through QML and GeoPackage styles for free, survive our own
  re-seeding, and are editable where users already look. TWO things
  override it: an approach the original library already takes (its
  semantics are the reference, and matching them keeps the plugin
  honest about what these maps are), and a plainly better piece of
  interface design that you can argue for. Those overrides are a
  large part of why `/grill-me` exists — the case for departing from
  the QGIS default is exactly the kind of decision to put to the user
  one question at a time, with the trade-off named, rather than
  settling it silently in either direction.

## Lessons learned here (do not relearn these the hard way)

**Qt/QGIS UI.**
- Data & colours handlers must NEVER trigger _rebuild_unit or
  _refresh_table. The rebuild replaces every table cell widget, and a
  rebuild debounced from one chooser pick lands mid-interaction with
  the next ("race among choosers": open dropdowns die, picks commit to
  dead widgets). Data-tab changes go through _refresh_preview_colours;
  a regression test asserts widget *identity* survives the debounce.
- A widget setCellWidget()ed into a hidden column can paint at the
  table's origin; and "blank" cells must be made by *removing* the
  widget, since some render paths paint hidden cell widgets anyway.
- sizeHint is stale before a real layout pass: invalidate child
  layouts and re-measure after showEvent, or you size to phantom rows.
- grab() of a never-shown dialog renders unreliable widget visibility
  offscreen; probe state programmatically, screenshot only after
  show().
- QgsMapLayerComboBox re-emits layerChanged whenever project layers
  churn (i.e. after every generation): its handler must be idempotent
  and guarded (auto-spacing fires once per layer id; outputs are
  tagged with a custom property and excluded so the plugin never
  offers its own output as a region).
- Label anchors: centroid for the visual centre; representative_point
  only as the inside-the-polygon fallback for concave shapes (it comes
  from a bbox-midheight scanline and reads off-centre).

**Testing.** The full record now lives in `docs/TESTING.md`, which is
REQUIRED READING before writing or changing tests, together with
`docs/MUTATION-TESTING.md` for the campaign that keeps the suite
honest. Both are binding, not background. The four that get violated
first, kept here so they are unmissable:
- Tests must run with an EMPTY project. Everything shares the one
  QgsProject singleton, so a test that leaves layers behind changes
  which layer the next dialog picks; a single real failure once
  cascaded into four unrelated ones.
- A test that PASSES is not a test that WORKS. It has to fail when the
  behaviour it names is broken, and the only way to know is to break
  it. Every test written to close a mutation gap gets an entry in
  `tools/mutation_check.py`, which does exactly that and runs at
  release. Six tests written in one session were verified to pass,
  and most of them then failed to kill the very mutants they were
  written for.
- The highest-value shape here is UI-against-library: drive the
  dialog, build the same map by calling weavingspace directly with
  what those settings MEAN, compare geometry element by element and
  then interior pixels. Write the expected side from the settings,
  never from `_build_unit`, or the test agrees with the bug.
- Every test that produces a map checks it visually (`visual_pair` or
  `visual_gamut`), and those checks appear in the release PDF.

**Process.**
- Check upstream's actual semantics before reimplementing behaviour:
  "unclassed" turned out to be matplotlib's linear Normalize (so 50
  equal intervals, not a new scheme), and categorical colours follow
  ListedColormap's sampling: code/(k-1) mapped through int(x*N),
  clamped — 5 on tab10 = entries 0,2,5,7,9. An earlier "derivation"
  used round() and got 0,2,4,7,9, painting the middle category purple
  instead of brown; only the colourspace comparison against an actual
  upstream render caught it. The reference is upstream's *rendered
  output*, not upstream's code read in a hurry, and certainly not
  intuition.
- After changing behaviour, re-audit nearby docstrings: this project's
  standard makes stale documentation actively harmful, and an audit
  found three lies (libs "appended", live update "after first
  Generate", the removed shared-file box).
- When batch-editing via heredoc Python scripts: assert every anchor
  BEFORE any write, and beware a trailing comma turning a string into
  a tuple (it aborted two patch runs here); for single replacements
  prefer the Edit tool.
- When waiting on a long background run, key the wait on the PROCESS
  ENDING, not on log text you predicted. A watcher polling for "tests
  recorded" sat in a sleep loop for twelve hours because the tool
  actually prints "recorded 75 tests", and its fallback pattern
  ("Error") missed the crash line too, which read "Fatal Python
  error". Silence from a watcher is not evidence that the work is
  still running. Wait on the pid, and if a log must be matched,
  include a case-insensitive alternation broad enough to catch the
  failure modes as well as the success line.
- A watcher that REPEATS itself misleads as badly as one that goes
  silent: a monitor grepping a whole log each pass re-reported the
  same historical failure every 45 seconds as though it were news,
  which makes the current state unreadable. Track an offset per file
  and emit only what is new. Between this and the twelve-hour poll
  above, the rule is: a watcher must report change, not state.
- macOS code-signing (library validation) refuses PyPI C extensions
  inside the signed QGIS process; side tooling that needs matplotlib
  runs in .venv-reference, never in QGIS's Python.

## Testing (do this after every substantive change)

Self-contained suite, synthetic data, runs under QGIS's bundled Python:

    bash tests/run_tests_macos.sh          # macOS, auto-detects the app

On this project's dev machine QGIS 4.0.3 lives at
`/Applications/QGIS-final-4_0_3.app` (vcpkg build, Python 3.12,
`PYTHONHOME=Contents/Frameworks`, `PROJ_LIB=Contents/Resources/qgis/proj`,
`QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen` works headless).

Dialog tests run offscreen with a stub iface (see `tests/run_tests.py`);
QMessageBox popups block headless runs, so live/silent code paths exist —
don't add unconditional modal dialogs to generation paths.

## Design decisions already settled (don't relitigate silently)

Confirmed with the user via an explicit design review:
- One layer per tile element in a layer-tree group; the old single-layer
  rule-based renderer output was deliberately removed.
- Generate replaces the group in place; hand styling survives unless
  that element's dialog assignment changed (signature comparison in
  `dialog._add_output_layers`). "Create as new group" is the comparison
  escape hatch.
- Renderers are seeded standard QGIS objects (graduated/categorized/
  single); refinement belongs to QGIS's styling dock, not a plugin UI.
- Ramps come from QgsStyle; missing mapweaver palettes are installed
  into it once, tagged "mapweaver" (additive only).
- Optional GPKG output embeds styles; live update renders a first map
  as soon as a layer and variables are in place (no button press) and
  is gated: memory-mode output only, estimated tiles ≤
  LIVE_UPDATE_MAX_TILES, and no-op runs skipped via _run_signature.
- Preview shows the tile unit with ONE ring of neighbouring copies by
  default (shells=1), with subtle centroid-anchored tile-id labels.
  This changed from shells=0 on 2026-08-08 at the user's instruction:
  the bare unit hides insetting and the joins between tiles, which are
  exactly the properties someone is inspecting the design view to
  judge. The unit alone remains one click away.
- "Quant: Unclassed" (50 linear intervals) is the sanctioned
  reproduction of a continuous ramp — derived from upstream semantics
  (n_classes=0 → matplotlib linear Normalize), not invented; see
  bridge.make_graduated_renderer.
- A style-only change NEVER re-tiles. `_geometry_signature()` decides:
  when it is unchanged, `_restyle_only()` re-seeds the existing layers
  in place. Ramp, scheme, class count, single colour, class source,
  reversal and opacity are all symbology; family, spacing, modifiers,
  switches, region layer, output path and the set of mapped variables
  are geometry. "Create as new group" always takes the full path.
- One run at a time, and the run is not over until its layers exist.
  `_finish_run()` clears the task only after `_add_output_layers`,
  because output building is main-thread work that a queued live run
  would otherwise start a second tiling underneath.
- Per-element colour controls sit in the table and belong to the
  ELEMENT, not the row widget: ramp, Reverse, class source, single
  colour and opacity all survive table rebuilds through dicts keyed by
  tile id. Columns appear only while they mean something (Classes
  whenever any row has a class count, including greyed categorical
  counts; Reverse while any element has a ramp).
- An element left on "---" stays unassigned through rebuilds and draws
  as plain fill. Class counts for quantitative styles run 2–20 (the
  ceiling is ours; the app has no such control at all).
- The region-outlines layer is drawn cased, a wide white line under a
  narrow black one, so boundaries stay legible over pale and dark
  parts of the pattern alike.
- The design view draws NO outline around its tiles. The preview
  exists to judge whether the shapes read as distinct elements by
  colour and form, and a dark hairline round every tile competes with
  exactly that; it also thickens relative to the tiles as the spacing
  gets finer, so a detailed pattern became a mesh. Tile boundaries on
  the MAP are a separate control and unaffected. (User instruction,
  2026-08-09.)
- The colour-legibility warnings (two elements a reader may not be
  able to separate, in ordinary vision or with a red-green
  deficiency) are OPT-IN, behind "Warn about lack of legibility in
  colour choices" on Map options, unchecked by default. They are a
  second opinion on a cartographic choice rather than a fault, and
  while somebody is still trying ramps they would fire on nearly
  every intermediate state, which is how a warning becomes something
  people learn to ignore. Both places the check can fire — after a
  run, and on closing the Categorical colour editor — are gated by
  the same box. (User instruction, 2026-08-09.)
- **The Categorical colour editor** (`category_editor.py`, the "Edit
  colours" column) lets a user set a colour per value. Settled by
  `/grill-me` on 2026-08-08; the decisions are the user's and should
  not be quietly revisited. Values come from the REGION layer, so the
  button works before anything is generated — accepting that at a
  coarse spacing it can list a value no tile carries. Colours are
  keyed `{tile_id: {field: {value: colour}}}`, so switching an
  element's variable away and back restores the work and two fields
  sharing a value name cannot bleed into each other. Choosing a ramp
  or importing a QML CLEARS that element's hand-picks for the current
  field, so the ramp control means what it says; the loss is reported,
  never silent. Overrides outrank both template and ramp in
  `make_categorized_renderer`, and the catch-all is editable under
  `bridge.NO_DATA_KEY`. The window is modal to the plugin dialog only,
  leaving the QGIS canvas live so the recolour can be watched. The
  editor NEVER holds a layer: it writes to the dialog's record and
  lets the restyle path find whatever layers exist, which is what
  makes it safe to use while a run is in flight. Two consequences that
  cost a bug each: the picks must be in `_signature` or the fast path
  skips the element as unchanged, and `_add_output_layers` must
  RE-READ them rather than trust the snapshot the run was launched
  with, or a colour chosen during a run is destroyed when it lands.
  They persist as a layer custom property so a saved project survives
  a QGIS restart.
- **A region layer with no CRS is tiled as it is, and its output says
  so.** QGIS permits a layer with no CRS and users sometimes want one
  (a floor plan, a scanned map, a diagram), so the plugin gets on with
  it: no reprojection, no warning, tiles in the layer's own
  coordinates. What it must NOT do is invent a CRS on the way out. A
  memory layer whose URI names no CRS is given EPSG:4326 by QGIS, so
  `gdf_to_layer` clears it explicitly when the frame has none;
  otherwise coordinates in the thousands ship labelled as degrees,
  placing the map off the edge of the world and inviting QGIS to
  reproject it. (User instruction, 2026-08-09: "if there's no CRS
  that's fine just proceed" and "no CRS shouldn't have a warning".)
- **A quantitative style never stands on a text field.** A graduated
  renderer over words comes back with no ranges at all, so every tile
  falls outside every class and the layer paints NOTHING — a group of
  full-looking layers drawing an empty map, reported as success. The
  correction is made in `_assignments`, which every consumer reads,
  and again in `_on_mode_chosen` so the chooser never goes on
  describing a map the plugin will not draw. The user is told.
- **A constant numeric column gets ONE class, and a notice.** Asked
  for five classes over a column that is 7 everywhere, QGIS returns
  five, all reading "7 - 7" in five different colours. The map was
  never wrong; the legend was, and the legend is what a reader trusts.
  `make_graduated_renderer` collapses to k=1 and the dialog reports
  it. (User instruction, 2026-08-09.)
- **The plugin follows the layer, and adapts where the answer is
  unambiguous.** QGIS is live and the dialog is not modal to it, so a
  user can delete features, simplify geometry in place, rename or
  retype a field, reassign a CRS or filter the layer while the plugin
  is pointed at it. Both signatures therefore carry a fingerprint of
  what the layer CONTAINS, and the dialog connects to the layer's own
  signals for edits a fingerprint cannot see (a value retyped, a
  vertex moved inside the bounding box). Where an edit makes a setting
  untrue AND there is exactly one sensible response, the dialog makes
  it and says so: an element whose column has gone RE-DEFAULTS to a
  surviving field (losing a column costs an element its variable, not
  its place on the map — unassigned draws as flat fill, so a deletion
  in QGIS would quietly cost the map two of its four variables), a
  column added in QGIS is offered straight away, the spacing is
  re-derived when the CRS changes, and the region layer being removed
  is reported rather than silently emptying the chooser. What it does
  NOT do is treat a vanished column and a new one as a rename: that is
  a coin flip that would map data nobody asked for. `repaintRequested` is
  deliberately not listened to in general, because it fires on style
  changes and re-tiling on those is the cost the restyle fast path
  exists to avoid.
- **NULLs are kept out of class breaks, and that is a WORKAROUND with
  an expiry test.** QGIS's classifier counts a NULL as zero while its
  own `minimumValue()` excludes nulls, so QGIS disagrees with itself
  and the classifier wins: a column with gaps gets a spurious 0-0
  class and every break shifted toward zero, on a map that looks
  perfectly plausible. Measured identically on the memory provider and
  on a GeoPackage through OGR (QGIS 4.0.3, 2026-08-09), so it reaches
  real data. `make_graduated_renderer` corrects the INPUT rather than
  the output: it hides the nulls with a subset string, lets QGIS's own
  classifier run, and restores the layer. Reimplementing quantiles,
  equal intervals, Jenks and pretty breaks here would mean owning four
  algorithms and inventing new ways to disagree with the styling panel
  the user opens next. It is safe because the layer being filtered is
  the ELEMENT OUTPUT layer, which the plugin creates and owns — never
  the user's region layer — and a provider that refuses the subset
  falls through to the old behaviour, since wrong breaks beat no map.
  The corrected breaks survive a project save and reload, a GeoPackage
  reopened elsewhere, and the plugin's own restyle path; they revert
  only if the user presses **Classify** in QGIS's Graduated panel,
  which recomputes with nulls counted as zero. That is why the notice
  exists as well as the fix. **When QGIS fixes this**,
  `test_qgis_still_counts_nulls_as_zero` fails — it asserts the bug,
  deliberately, going straight to QGIS. Treat that failure as good
  news: delete the marked block in `make_graduated_renderer` and the
  canary, keep `missing_values_message`, and do NOT relax the
  assertion to make the suite green. (User instruction, 2026-08-09.)
- **The dependency consent dialogue states what can be checked.**
  `deps.py` downloads wheels from PyPI where QGIS lacks the scientific
  stack or carries a version below the floor — most often Linux, where
  QGIS uses the system Python, but the trigger is "missing OR too old"
  and can fire anywhere. That is the most intrusive thing this plugin
  does and the thing a QGIS plugin repository reviewer will examine
  hardest, so the dialogue (`plugin.dependency_consent_box`) names the
  packages, the source (PyPI), the exact destination folder, what is
  NOT touched, how to undo it, and what declining costs — and the
  buttons say what they do, with the SAFE one as the default so a
  stray Return cannot start a download. It is built as its own
  function rather than inline so it can be tested and photographed
  without owning a machine that happens to be missing a package;
  `test_the_dependency_consent_says_what_it_will_do` asserts each
  promise. If you change the wording, keep every one of those
  elements: they are what make it consent rather than a prompt.
  (User instruction, 2026-08-09.)
- **Raster sources are not a case here.** A COG, a WMS or any other
  raster cannot be a region layer: the region chooser filters to
  polygon layers, and the tiling joins data to POLYGONS. Raster-backed
  data reaches this plugin only after somebody has vectorised it,
  which produces an ordinary vector layer covered by everything above.
  Worth writing down because "what about cloud raster data" is a
  reasonable question with a short answer.
- **A layer the plugin cannot count is a snapshot, and says so.** WFS,
  OGC API - Features, an ArcGIS service and PostGIS can all change
  server-side with no local event, and may report `featureCount()` as
  -1 or an estimate. An explicit Generate always re-tiles such a
  layer; live update does not chase it, because polling somebody's
  WFS endpoint unattended is not a thing to do behind their back, and
  the user is told once that live update cannot track this source. A
  layer with QGIS's own auto-refresh enabled IS followed, since
  turning that on is the user declaring the data dynamic.
- The repository is public at `FoldingSpace/weavingspaceQGIS`, with
  the project page served by GitHub Pages from `docs/` on the main
  branch (so a single push updates code, documentation and page
  together). `reports/`, `dist/` and `.venv-reference/` are NOT
  committed: reports run to tens of megabytes per version and git
  keeps every blob forever, so each release attaches its report, PDF
  and zip to a GitHub Release instead. Copyright on the plugin is
  Luke Bergmann's, with the vendored library's own MIT notice
  reproduced separately in LICENSE.md; `metadata.txt` names Bergmann
  alone as author, since plugin bug reports should reach whoever can
  act on them. `deps.py`'s PyPI download is disclosed plainly in the
  metadata, the README and the page rather than left to be
  discovered, which is also what the QGIS plugin repository's
  reviewers will want to see.

## Cross-version compatibility targets

QGIS 4+ only (PyQt6, Python 3.12+), on the major platforms. Enums in
scoped form (`Qt.AlignmentFlag.AlignCenter`); `QAction` imports from
qgis.PyQt.QtWidgets (QGIS 4 shims it there). compat.py holds the QGIS
4 spellings and absorbs future transitions.

## The original library: its role and how to upgrade it

The vendored `weavingspace_qgis/vendor/weavingspace/` (upstream
v0.0.7.61) does ALL the mathematics and cartography — unit
construction, tiling geometries, weave matrices, transforms, and
`Tiling.get_tiled_map()`'s grid/overlay/join. Plugin code never
computes a tiling; it is the QGIS shell around that library
(parameters in, GeoDataFrame⇄layer conversion, symbology, threading,
guards). Keep that boundary: behaviour that belongs to the tiling
belongs upstream, and where the plugin must reproduce an upstream
behaviour in QGIS terms (unclassed ramps, categorical colour
sampling), derive it from upstream's actual semantics and document the
derivation at the implementation.

Upgrading upstream is a script, not a project:

    python3 tools/vendor_weavingspace.py /path/to/weavingspace/weavingspace
    python3 release.py

The tool copies the new upstream and re-applies the remaining patch
family (optional matplotlib/scipy imports), asserting on exact
upstream anchors and NAMING any
patch whose anchor no longer matches instead of writing a broken
vendor. Never hand-edit vendor files: a hand edit is lost at the next
re-vendor. New patches go into the tool, documented like the existing
ones. The catalogue in `catalog.py` holds the web app's
`tilings_by_n` dict verbatim (mapweaver repo, app.py) PLUS two
sanctioned library extras appended by a loop after the literal
(stripes, grid — user-approved 2026-08-06; users are deliberately
NOT told which families the app lacks). When syncing against a new
app release, update the literal only and leave the loop alone.
The custom ("this") weave type, with its tie-up/treadling/threading
matrices, is DEPRIORITIZED rather than rejected: it needs a
matrix-entry UI and its own documentation, and the user may return to
it.

## QGIS breaking changes: the playbook

A future QGIS transition (4→5, as 3→4 before it) WILL break APIs. The
standing arrangement: every version-sensitive QGIS/Qt call goes
through `compat.py` (nothing else may try/except a QGIS API), which
currently holds plain QGIS 4 spellings. When breakage arrives: run the
test suite under the new QGIS — the first failing test names the
broken area — then add a fallback branch to the relevant compat
helper, keeping the old branch and noting the QGIS version in its
docstring. If something breaks outside compat.py, moving that call
into compat.py is part of the fix. Likely fracture points are listed
in MAINTAINING.md (enum access, QgsField construction,
QgsVectorFileWriter options, saveStyleToDatabase, classification class
names, qgis.PyQt shims).

## The test suite: what it is for and how it runs

Six pieces, all modern Python (the functional suite, visual gallery
and mutation campaigns run under QGIS's bundled 3.12; the reference
comparison in `.venv-reference`, Python 3.14). The first two are the
tests themselves; the rest ask how good those tests are:

1. `tests/run_tests.py` — the regression record of every bug this
   project has fixed (PROJ threading, size guard, auto-render, chooser
   race, spacing persistence, per-row symbology, GPKG round trips).
   Every fixed bug gets a test here; a bug without a regression test
   is not fixed.
2. `tests/visual_tests.py` — canonical weavingspace outputs rendered
   through the plugin pipeline, with coarse image checks plus CIELAB
   distance-to-ramp criteria, writing reports/v<version>/index.html.
3. `tools/coverage_report.py` — which plugin lines the functional
   suite never reaches (stdlib `sys.monitoring`, since PyPI packages
   cannot load in the signed QGIS process). Reported in every
   release, never gating.
4. `tools/mutation_check.py` — breaks each guarded behaviour in turn
   and requires its test to fail. Not part of the release gate (it
   rewrites source files); run it before substantial releases.
5. `tools/mutate_auto.py` — the same question asked without a human
   choosing the targets: mutants generated from the syntax tree,
   sampled at random, each run against only the tests that cover its
   line, inside a throwaway clone. This is the MEASUREMENT (the
   hand-picked catalogue measures our judgement); its commitments and
   campaign history are in `docs/MUTATION-TESTING.md`.
6. `tools/visual_reference_report.py` — each gallery render scored in
   Lab colourspace (pixel-weighted nearest-neighbour ΔE both
   directions, p90, background fraction) against the ORIGINAL
   renderer, `TiledMap.render`, on identical inputs; where quantile
   classing alone explains a mismatch, the gallery's Quant: Unclassed
   render is scored instead. Writes visual-comparison.pdf.

The suite, the gallery, the coverage report and the reference
comparison run, in order and gated, via `python3 release.py`, which
refuses to build the zip on any failure and leaves the HTML report and
the PDF under reports/v<version>/. Around them sit the publication
steps, in this order: standards check, secrets audit, the four test
stages above, the testing report, a re-photographing of the published
images, the published-content audit, the zip, then commit and tag —
and, with `--push` only, the push and the GitHub Release with the zip,
testing report and PDF attached. `--push` is the single point at which
anything leaves the machine. Rerun the comparison alone with
`./.venv-reference/bin/python3 tools/visual_reference_report.py
reports/v<version>/` after a gallery run has populated the PNGs.

On "three-way" comparison (library vs web app vs plugin): the PDF's
reference column IS both of the first two at once, because MapWeaver
pins this same library version and draws through this same
TiledMap.render call inside pyodide — a browser screenshot would
re-photograph the identical code path with UI chrome added, so no
separate column exists. CONDITION TO WATCH, now triggered but harmless: as of 2026-08-07 the
vendor is 0.0.7.61 while the app still pins 0.0.7.59. The two were
compared structurally (AST with docstrings stripped) before the
bump: 0.0.7.61 adds MIT licence headers and NOTHING else, so the
rendering path is byte-for-byte the same behaviour and the single
reference column still speaks for both. Re-check with the same AST
comparison at the next upstream bump; if a release ever changes
behaviour while the app lags, a live browser capture becomes a
genuinely independent third column and should be added then.
